# In the Name of ALLAH
# Observer Pattern
---

## Definition

- Define a _one to many_ dependancy between objects so that when one object changes __state__ all its dependents are _notified_ and updated __automatically__.

---

## The Concept
- Many __Observers__ (objects) that are observing a particular __subject__ (some object).
- Observers want to be __notified__ when there are a __change__ made inside the __subject__.
- They register themseleves to the subject (subscripe).
- When they lose interest in the subject, they unregister from the subject.
- The Subject can send notifications to multible observers at the same time.
